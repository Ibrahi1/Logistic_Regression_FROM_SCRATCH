## 🧠 Logistic Regression from Scratch
A simple implementation of Logistic Regression using NumPy, with a demonstration using the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets. This project showcases binary classification using gradient descent optimization and evaluates performance with accuracy.

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```
## 📁 Project Structure

├── Logistic_Regression_Implementation.py   # Contains the LogisticRegression class and accuracy function
